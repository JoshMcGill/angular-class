           <h1>Josh McGill</h1>
            <p>My name is Josh McGill, i'm married to my best friend Jori as of this year (2015). I am a technology enthusiast, i have always loved anything to do with technology, whether its video games, phones, computers and web technologies. Because of this, I have fallen in love with writing computer code to build websites and web apps.</p>
            <p>One of my hobbies is writing code. I started writing coding the last year of high school in an intro to web development class. We learned how to build websites using HTML and CSS and i realized then that this is what i wanted to do for the rest of my life. Since then i have taken courses at UVU and at Coding Campus. So far i have learned how to write in HTML, CSS, Javascript and the javascript library Angular.</p>
            <p>Another hobby of mine is playing video games. Ever since i was a little kid, video games have been my way to hangout with friends and spend my off time. It all started with Super Mario 64 and has branched out to more multiplayer games and games on computer. The game that i find myself playing the most the past few years is called League of Legends. I play with all my friends and watch the professional matches live on the weekends.</p>
            <p>One of my other hobbies is playing music. I have always been obsessed with writing music and playing instruments. I self taught myself to play guitar and i have been playing for 5 or so years. I have a few guitars of my own including an acoustic and an electric guitar. I was in a rock band during high school before we switched to just acoustic music for a few years. We were called “A Long Time Running”, and I played the bass guitar and wrote guitar parts for the songs. I have personally written several songs for my wife and other aspects of my life which i post on Facebook and Youtube.</p>
